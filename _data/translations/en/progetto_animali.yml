  main_title: "Donate an animal, change a life"
  p1: "Anyone who owns an animal knows exactly what we mean. The joy that a pet can bring to a home is indescribable. And when this animal, introduced to a poor family, also becomes a source of sustenance because it provides milk or eggs, the joy multiplies. But the project doesn't stop there. With this gift, we want to instill in Kenyan families the idea that even one, or better yet two ducklings, can become a resource. Unfortunately, in the area where we operate, people live day to day, unable to even think about what they might choose to eat for breakfast tomorrow. Providing an animal in such a situation means allowing people to open their minds and try to see if raising even a few animals could be an opportunity to improve their condition."
