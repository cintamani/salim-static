  p1: "Salim is the name of the first child that Jessica Donadio, a very young Roman girl visiting Kenya, held in her arms back in 2014. Since then, a deep love for these people has ignited in Jessica's heart, and over time she began connecting the needs of the local population with the financial resources of people scattered across Italy and the world."
  p2: "More than 80 people in Europe, America, and Australia have already chosen to trust Jessica's transparency and dedication. In recent years, several people have decided to see firsthand the hard work and dedication with which every aspect of this work is carried out by Jessica and her husband Salimu, and in the last two years a support team has formed around this reality, made up of IT experts, communication professionals, lawyers, and enthusiasts who led to the founding of this association in June 2024."
  p3: "The association now wants to continue the work started by Jessica, with the same characteristics of transparency and reliability: every month, for every donation received, a detailed report is sent showing how every euro is spent, with an attached photo of the delivery or use of the service."
  p4: "This way you can <strong>be sure that your gesture is bearing the fruit it should</strong>."
